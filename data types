#C.R.I.B.S is a way to remember all the data types

#You can "cast" for data types
#for example:
name = str(input("enter name"))
#in this code, str means we want the data entered...
#... as a string

age = int(input("enter age"))
#in this code, int means we want the data entered...
#... as an integer

price = float(input("enter price"))
#in this code, float means we want the data entered...
#... as a decimal number

#This is called "casting" for data types
